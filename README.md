# Paper Glide – WebGL Prototype

![Gameplay Example](./gameplay.gif)  
*Screenshot: Early prototype gameplay*

## Overview

**Paper Glide** is a prototype browser game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, built using Unity and exported as a WebGL build.  
Fly through a pixel-art cityscape as a paper-themed character, dodging obstacles and aiming for a high score.  
This project is an early proof-of-concept and not a finished product—expect placeholder art, basic mechanics, and experimental features.
